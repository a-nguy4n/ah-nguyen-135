## Changes made to collector.js 
- For the static data collection, to figure out JS collection, we trivially set it to true and then had noscript tags on each page since if our collector.js runs that means JS is allowed. For the images, we created a small image that was hidden on the homepage and then checked to see if it loaded or not. For the CSS collection, we checked link lengths and to see if CSS external sheets worked and loaded.
