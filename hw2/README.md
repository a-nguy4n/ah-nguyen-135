## 3rd party analytics
For our third approach to third-party analytics, we evaluated alternatives to Google Analytics and LogRocket that were easier to use and more focused on user behavior. We already considered tools such as Plausible and Matomo, but we found them to have some sort of paywall or a bit difficult to use. 
As such we chose Microsoft Clarity because it is free, easy to install, and provides visual insights through heatmaps and user’s session recordings. Microsoft Clarity’s analytic features allowed us to actually see how users interacted with the site. For instance, the session recordings and logs showed us where they clicked and how far they scrolled. This made it easier to identify usability issues and areas for improvement. Compared to Log Rocket, Clarity required less setup and was easier to understand.
